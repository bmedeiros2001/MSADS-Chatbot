That is why we opted to try this strategy. For that, we knew two possible platforms: `Markdownify` and `Scraping Ant`. After some research, we decided to go with `Markdownigy`, as `Scraping Ant` was for more JavaScript-heavy websites, which we did not find to be the case with the M.S. in Applied Data Science one.\n","\n","**Benefits of this approach:**\n","- Better semantic search (headings provide context)\n","- You preserve links for reference tracking\n","- You can keep table structure retention (this was important for the course schedule page, specifically)\n","- Appropriately formats lists\n","\n","**Why not Beautiful Soup?** It removed all semantic HTML elements. This meant headings, lists, links, and tables became plain text, making it impossible for LLMs to understand document hierarchy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Strategy 2: Intelligent Content Extraction with Multiple Selectors\n","This attempts to find the main content area using multiple CSS selectors in order of preference: `<main>, <article>, <div class=\"content\">, <div id=\"content\">`, before falling back to `<body>`.\n","\n","**Why do this?** Many websites don't use semantic HTML5 tags. Some use `<main>`, others use `<article>`. Our solution improves chances of finding actual content area rather than grabbing entire page with `nav` and `footer`.\n","\n","**Benefits:**\n","- Reduces noise from repeated navigation menus\n","- Eliminates footer content on every page\n","- Focuses embedding vectors on actual page content, which improves search relevance, since it excludes boilerplate that would serve as noise\n","\n","```bash\n","pythonmain_content = (\n","    soup.find('main') or\n","    soup.find('article') or\n","    soup.find('div', class_='content') or\n","    soup.find('div', id='content') or\n","    soup.body\n",")\n","```\n","---\n","### Strategy 3: Removing Navigation Elements and Sidebars\n","After identifying the main content, removes `<nav>, <footer>, <aside>`, and `<header>` from inside the main content.\n","\n","**Why do this?** Even iside the `main` area, there might be some noise. It is good procedure because:\n","- Improves token efficiency in vector databases\n","- Prevents irrelevant matches (searching for \"financial aid\" won't match every page with a \"Financial Aid\" link in the sidebar)\n","- Creates even cleaner, more focused documents\n","\n","```bash\n"," aside_count = len(main_content.find_all('aside'))\n","        for element in main_content.find_all(['nav', 'footer', 'aside', 'header']):\n","            print(f\"Removing {element.name} tag\")\n","            element.decompose()\n","        print(f\"Removed {aside_count} aside tags\")\n","```\n","---\n","### Strategy 4: URL Fragment Cleaning to Prevent Duplicates\n","This removes URL fragments (everything after #) before checking if a URL has been visited, preventing the same page from being scraped multiple times with different anchors.\n","\n","**Why do this?** Websites often have internal links to sections: `/page#section1`, `/page#section2`, `/page#main`. Without cleaning, the scraper treats these as different URLs and scrapes the same page multiple times. This was a problem with the UChicago websie, specifically witht the `accordion-tab`. For both the in-person and online program pages, several `accordion-tab` were saved, all with the exact same content. You can see in this image:\n","\n","<img src=\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Gen AI Shared/download.png\" width=\"400\">\n","\n","For a larger-scale project, this mistake could severely increase storage and processing costs. Either way, it eliminates duplicated documents in the vector database.\n","\n","``` bash\n","pythonfrom urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse\n","\n","parsed = urlparse(url)\n","base_url = urlunparse(parsed._replace(fragment=''))\n","\n","if base_url in visited:\n","    print(f\"{'  ' * depth}  Skipping duplicate: {url}\")\n","    return data\n","\n","visited.add(base_url)\n","```\n","---\n","### Strategy 6: Extracting Footer Content Separately\n","\n","On the first page only, extracts the footer content and saves it as a separate markdown file with a semantic name like contact_and_policies.md.\n","\n","We did this because the footer has relevant information and we wanted to save it once. Instead of leaving it in every page, we saved it once.\n","\n","\n","```bash\n","if url == start_url and depth == 0:\n","    footer = soup.find('footer')\n","    if footer:\n","        footer_text = md(str(footer))\n","        with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/Gen AI Shared/msads_pages_bruna/contact_and_policies.md', 'w') as f:\n","            f.write(\"# Data Science Institute - Contact Information and Policies\\n\\n\")\n","            f.write(footer_text)\n","        print(\"  ✓ Saved footer information separately\")\n","```\n","---\n","### Strategy 6: Creating a Metadata Manifest\n","Generates a JSON file containing metadata about each scraped page including filename, URL, word count, character count, and scrape timestamp.\n","\n","**Why do this?**\n","Without a manifest, we'd need to open each markdown file to understand what was scraped, making it difficult to track scraping coverage, debug missing content and understand the dataset structure.\n","\n","More than improving RAG, this is helpful in debugging (good standards). It also helps us to figure out an error or need for improvement of the RAG retrieval (testing).\n","\n","```bash\n","manifest = []\n","for idx, row in df_final.iterrows():\n","    manifest.append({\n","        'filename': filename,\n","        'url': row['url'],\n","        'word_count': len(row['text'].split()),\n","        'char_count': len(row['text']),\n","        'scraped_date': datetime.now().isoformat()\n","    })\n","\n","with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/Gen AI Shared/manifest.json', 'w') as f:\n","    json.dump(manifest, f, indent=2)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Strategy 7: Creating a Combined Document for Simple RAG (PONTENTIALLY UNNECESSARY... CHECK)\n","**this could be redundant, because i will be uploading the spearate files in RAG.ipynb**\n","\n","In addition to individual files, creates one large markdown file containing all scraped content with clear section separators and a table of contents. Some RAG systems work better with single large documents rather than many small files. It's another option, and we'll test which one is better in our system.\n","\n","```bash\n","combined_md = \"# MS in Applied Data Science - Complete Documentation\\n\"\n","combined_md += f\"*Generated: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}*\\n\"\n","\n","# Add table of contents\n","for idx, row in df_final.iterrows():\n","    page_name = url_parts[-1] or url_parts[-2] or 'index'\n","    combined_md += f\"- [{page_name}](#{idx:03d}-{page_name.lower()})\\n\"\n","\n","# Add all content with clear separators\n","for idx, row in df_final.iterrows():\n","    combined_md += f\"\\n\\n## {idx:03d}-{page_name.lower()}\\n\"\n","    combined_md += f\"*Source: {row['url']}*\\n\\n\"\n","    combined_md += row['text']\n","    combined_md += \"\\n\\n---\"\n","```\n","\n","### Strategy 8: Configuring Markdownify for Consistency\n","\n","This passes specific parameters to Markdownify to ensure consistent formatting: ATX headers (#), dash bullets (-), and asterisk emphasis (*).\n","\n","**Why do this?** Default markdownify might use different styles inconsistently:\n","- Headers might be underlined (Setext) or prefixed with # (ATX)\n","- Bullets might be *, -, or +\n","- Emphasis might be * or _\n","\n","This inconsistency makes parsing and chunking more difficult.\n","\n","``` bash\n","text = md(\n","    str(main_content),\n","    heading_style=\"ATX\",      # Always use # for headers\n","    bullets=\"-\",              # Always use - for bullets\n","    strong_em_symbol=\"*\"      # Always use * for bold/italic\n",")\n","```\n","---\n","### Strategy 9: Cleaning Excessive Whitespace\n","Uses regex to replace more than two consecutive newlines with exactly two newlines, cleaning up excessive whitespace that often results from HTML conversion. We didn't see specific cases in the UChicago website, but we thought it was safer to run this cleaning step.\n","\n","- Divs with padding/margins\n","- Empty paragraphs for spacing\n","- Multiple nested containers\n","\n","``` bash\n","import re\n","\n","# Clean up excessive newlines (more than 2 in a row)\n","text = re.sub(r'\\n{3,}', '\\n\\n', text)\n","\n","# Clean up spacing around headers\n","text = re.sub(r'\\n\\n+#', '\\n\\n#', text)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","### Strategy 10: Smart Filename Generation from URLs\n","\n","Extracts meaningful filenames from URLs by taking the last path segment (or second-to-last if the last is empty) and combining with a numeric prefix for ordering. In simpler terms, appropriately name the many markdown files the code is creating, so it is more interpretable and easier to find.\n","\n","``` bash\n","url_parts = row['url'].rstrip('/').split('/')\n","filename = url_parts[-1] or url_parts[-2] or 'index'\n","filename = f\"{idx:03d}_{filename}.md\"\n","```\n","---\n","\n","### Strategy 11: Removing Image Tags During Processing\n","Identifies and removes all <img> tags from the HTML before converting to markdown.
