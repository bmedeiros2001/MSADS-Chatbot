  Core

  - [Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)

    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.

  Core

  - [Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)

    Professional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.
